# My First Repository
This is my first repository

# Introduction

I created this repository as an exercise in my graduate seminar GEOG 712 as a means of practicing how to use _GitHub_ and _GitHub Desktop_. I believe that by creating repositories for my work I will be able to better track my changes made to my work, as well as opening up my work for corrections and edits by my peers.

By having the above applications installed on my desktop, I can create changes in __R Markdown__ and save the changes I've made to a local file on my GitHub Desktop. These changes will then only be saved locally so I will be able to go back and edit my work untill I am happy with it. Once I like the changes I have made to my files, then i can commit my changes to my master file in my repository on GitHub which will then be accessable to the public.

Other interesting features associated with these applications, im my ability to download and clone a repository that I've found on GitHub and add it to my local repository where i can make changes and update the file as i desire. The changes i make on this cloned repository will also only be saved locally untill i commit the changes. 

### But what if changes are made to the master while im working on it?

No need to fret! you can also pull changes from the master file on _GitHub Desktop_ and the changes made on the files from the web browser repository will be updated in your desktop application.


This repository I have created will prove very usefull for my field of research and will help me develop my own reproducible research.
