# My First Repository
This is my first repository

# Background

I created this repository as an exercise in my graduate seminar GEOG 712 

### Cloning a Repository

I cloned my repository and saved it to a local file. these changes I'm making will only be saved locally

### Second step sync with remote repository

 you dont have to commit every single little change. they can be saved locally untill youre ready 
 if you make changes on the web browser you can go on your github desktop and pull changes from the master file so that they update in the desktop application what may have been changed online
